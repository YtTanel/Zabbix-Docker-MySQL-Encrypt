# Zabbix MySQL encryption 
Zabbix MySQL encryption using Dockerfiles and Docker Compose. This requires CA, keys and certs. Since I don't know what the names of your CA, keys and certs are going to be, you may have to edit the Dockerfiles and my.cnfs to specify the correct names and locations you want to put them in the containers.

## Docker Compose and .env
Edit the .env to your needs
